# Surround vs Caffe, comparing machine learning frameworks.

Data is the new oil. Making use of the data around us is becoming increasingly important for businesses and organisations and nobody wishes to be left behind. Machine Learning is a powerful tool that enables anyone to analyse and derive meaningful insights from vast amount of data. But it is not everyone's cup of tea. There are many challenges people face while employing machine learning algorithms and how these problems are addressed makes all the difference between getting a result that has any real-world significance.

## Machine Learning Frameworks

Machine Learning Frameworks are created to address some of the problems data scientist's face and enable them to complete their analysis in an efficient and timely manner. There are many such frameworks available out there, each focusing on a select subset of the issues and providing a wide range of functionalities. In this blog, we will be looking into two such frameworks, Surround and Caffe.

## Surround

Surround is an open-source framework developed and maintained by Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A2I2). More than a framework, the creators of Surround treat it as a philosphy aimed at reducing the efforts between data exploration and application deployment. It is aimed to be used by both developers and researchers and boasts of a powerful command line tool.

### Pro's:
- **Flexibility**: Surround is built with flexibility in mind and it supports the use of almost all the existing frameworks allowing the users to leverage multiple technologies to get the task done. Surround's documentations claim it supports TensorFlow and PyTorch among other frameworks as well as Google Cloud AI, SageMaker and other cloud services which makes it pretty flexible versatile in its application.
- **CLI**: Surround comes with a powerful command line tool which coupled with its python library allows many intermediate analysis tasks to be completed in short span of time. From creating the project templates and pipelines to deploying it, the command line takes care of all the needs of a machine learner.
- **One framework for all**: Surround enforces a set of conventions to be followed thereby making sure that it is useful for researchers and developers. It is not tailor made for any specific type of machine learning problem and rather strives to provide support to all types of it which makes it the only framework you need to solve your problems. Combining this with the flexibility it provides as described above, Surround offers a single place to take care of all issues arising when developing machine learning algorithms.
- **Platforms**: Surround can be installed on all three major computing platforms, Windows, Mac and Linux.

### Con's:
- **Maturity**: Surround is currently used and maintained by A2I2 and is still in the development phase and not adopted by machine learners around the globe. It needs more widespread adoption and contributions from users for it to achieve it's potential.
- **Documentation**: Surround lacks extensive documentation and beginner friendly guides that could generate interest in it and increase its popularity and maturity.

## Caffe

Caffe, developed at University of California, Berkley, is an open-source deep learning framework used primarily for image classification. It supports CNN as well as RCNN network designs. The main point of interest in Caffe are the pre-trained models that can be used without the need to code making it popular with beginners in the field of machine learning.

### Pro's:
- **Maturity**: Caffe is being used my many large corporations including Facebook as well as startups and academic projects. It's GitHub repository as over 4K commits from 250+ contributors indicating a vibrant environment. A Google Group of Caffe users to discuss issues eases debugging issues and encourages widespread adoption.
- **Documentation**: Caffe has extensive documentation in place catering beginner as well as advance users to ensure the steep learning curve is eased up. From practical examples of implenting a framework from scratch, different documentation for API as well as underlying framework to laying down guidelines for contribution on GitHub, the exhaustive documentation ensures better applicability of the framework as well smoothens up synchronization among different contributors.
- **Multi-Platform**: Like Surround, Caffe is available to be used at all the major platforms, including Windows, Mac and Ubuntu.

### Con's:
- **Slow development**: Despite it's popularity development into caffe has slowed down recently and the framework might be starting at a dead end. It has recently been replaced by Caffe2 by Facebook in 2017 resulting in even fewer contributions and usage.
- **Complexity**: Caffe has been criticised for it's convoluted codes consequently increasing the complexity of the task at hand rather than reducing it. 

# Conclusion:
Both Caffe and Surround are excellent machine learning frameworks saving machine learners plenty of time and energy and allowing them to focus more on business problem than technical complexities. Each framework has an area in which it excels and lags and it depends upon the user's usecase which of the above framework would work best.
